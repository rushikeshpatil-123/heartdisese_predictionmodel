# heartdisese_predictionmodel

Objective:

Type of Analysis: MultiVariate\Classification Model

Data Information

age: age in years

sex: sex

1 = male

0 = female

cp: chest pain type

Value 0: typical angina

Value 1: atypical angina

Value 2: non-anginal pain

Value 3: asymptomatic

trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)

1 = true;

0 = false

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results

Value 0: normal

Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

exang: exercise induced angina

1 = yes

0 = no

oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

Value 0: upsloping

Value 1: flat

Value 2: downsloping

ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal:

0 = error (in the original dataset 0 maps to NaN's)

1 = fixed defect

2 = normal

3 = reversable defect

target (the lable):

0 = no disease,

1 = disease

Note on the target label:

Diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)

Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing

Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing
